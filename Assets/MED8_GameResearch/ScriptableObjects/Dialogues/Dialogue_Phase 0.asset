  - 'Welcome to my dusty ol'' furniture workshop, kid! '
  - "Around here, you\u2019ll be crafting the finest digital chairs, tables, and
    who-knows-what-else with the magic of code!"
  - Just drag stuff where it fits.
  - Think of it like assembling IKEA furniture
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll guide you so you don\u2019t hammer your keyboard
    instead of the nails!"
  - Alright! If you're ready to make your first masterpiece...
  - ...then go ahead and Open Shop! Let the sawdust fly!
