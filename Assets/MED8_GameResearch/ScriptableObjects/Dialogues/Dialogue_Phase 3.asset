  - Hola.
  - Interfaces, eh?
  - "Think of \u2018em like contracts from the furniture guild."
  - They list what behaviors something should have.
  - They say, "If you use me, you must include certain actions."
  - "They don\u2019t tell you how to do them though - that\u2019s your job, craftsman."
  - 'For example, if a furniture uses a Storable interface, it must know how to store
    things. '
  - 'Just remember this: while you can only inherit one blueprint, you can sign as
    many contracts as you like!'
  - "Each adds a new trick, and none of \u2018em argue with each other!"
  - Ok, get ready for next day!
