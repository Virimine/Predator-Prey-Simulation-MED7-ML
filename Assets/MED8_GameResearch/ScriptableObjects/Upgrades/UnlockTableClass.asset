  description: "Unlock the [furniture] class. \nWarning: You can only use one class
    at a time.\n\nA Class is a 'blueprint' that wraps  pieces of data, and behavior
    that defines the structure for objects. It is like a recipe \u2014it tells you
    what parts (data) and actions (behavior) the furniture should have. For example,
    it could define how something should look and behave."
